# 🎵 Music Popularity Analysis (Spotify Dataset Visualization)

🔗 **Live Demo:**  
https://cs-aashishjayapuram7.github.io/CSCE567-Final-Project/

This project is an interactive data visualization dashboard built using **Tableau** to analyze how musical characteristics differ between **highly popular** and **less popular** songs on Spotify. It explores how features such as energy, danceability, tempo, valence, speechiness, and loudness vary across genres and evolve over time.

The goal of this project is to uncover patterns that help explain what makes a song popular and how musical trends shift across genres and years.
